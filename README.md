# HTML---Tags
I started coding on 01/23/23 with HTML. "Angle bracket" is abbreviated as "ab" to indicate <>.

<p><button>
Creates a button
</button> to close the command.</p>

<p>Examples:
<button>Like
  </button> 
<button>Dislike
  </button> 
<button>Send
  </button>
<button>Log In
  </button></p>

<p>Some words are shortened. For exmaple, "paragraph" is [angle bracket]p[/angle bracket].
There are size heading sizes that range from [ab]h1[ab] the boldest and biggest to [ab]h6[ab] the least bold and smallest:
	<h1>I love you, Oliver</h1>
	<h3>I'll find a job within the next year and get you signifiant help</h3></p>

<p>An element is what we call the opening tag, closing tab, and code in between.
To create an empty HTML webpage, add <html> with a closing.
Use:	<html>
		<body>
		</body>
	</html>
For the structure of a webpage. Elements I want to display go inside of the html.</p>

To make break in the paragraph, add [ab]br[/ab]. It's called a "break tag".
<html>
  <body>
    <h1> My favorite things </h1>
    <p>
    Raindrops on roses<br>
    Whiskers on kittens<br>
    Bright copper kettles<br>
    Warm woolen mittens
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
