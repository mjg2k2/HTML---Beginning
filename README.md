# HTML---Tags
I started coding on 01/23/23 with HTML

<button>
Creates a button
</button> to close the command.

Examples:
<button>Like
  </button> 
<button>Dislike
  </button> 
<button>Send
  </button>
<button>Log In
  </button>

Some words are shortened. For exmaple, "paragraph" is <p>.
There are size heading sizes that range from <h1> the boldest and biggest to <h6> the least bold and smallest.
	<h1>I love you, Oliver</h1>
	  <h3>I'll find a job within the next year and get you signifiant help</h3>

An element is what we call the opening tag, closing tab, and code in between.
To create an empty HTML webpage, add <html> with a closing.
Use:	<html>
		<body>
		</body>
	</html>
	For the structure of a webpage. Elements I want to display go inside of the html.
