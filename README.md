# HTML---Tags
I started coding on 01/23/23 with HTML
<button>
Creates a button
</button> to close the command.
Examples:
<button>Like</button> 
<button>Dislike</button> 
<button>Send</button>
<button>Log In</button>

Some words are shorten. For exmaple, "paragraph" is <p>.
There are size heading sizes that range from <h1> the boldest and biggest to <h6> the least bold and smallest.
<h1>I love you, Oliver</h1>
